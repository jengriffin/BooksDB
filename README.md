### **_Description_**

Building off an old collaborative project, this will be an interactive database that collects user submitions of childrens books for educational purposes looking for writing features, culural diversity, and themes. A link will allow the user to read about an author and discover their other works that have been added to the data base. Users will be able to build, edit, and delete entries.
